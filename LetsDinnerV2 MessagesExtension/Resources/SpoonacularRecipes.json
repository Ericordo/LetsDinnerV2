Stir them with a wooden spoon or shake the pan from time to time. You may hear them squeak.\nSprinkle salt over the mushrooms. The mushrooms will sizzle and then start to release water. (Note that you are not adding fat at this point to the pan; this method of cooking mushrooms in their own moisture is called \"dry sautéing.)\nOnce the mushrooms start to release water into the pan, stir in the chopped onions. Cook until the mushrooms are no longer releasing moisture and the mushroom water has boiled away, about 5 minutes more.\n\nMake the sauce: Add the olive oil to the mushrooms and stir to coat. Sauté the mushrooms and onions for about a minute. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.\nStir in the tomato paste, cook for a minute longer. Reserve 1 cup of the tomato sauce (it will go in the bottom of the casserole dish), and put the remaining cup of tomato sauce into the pot with the mushrooms.  Add the large can of crushed tomatoes and one cup of water.\nStir in the thyme, sugar, and red pepper flakes. (If you are using dried basil instead of fresh, add it now.) Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and simmer on a low simmer, for 20 minutes.\n\nBoil and drain the lasagna noodles: Once the sauce is simmering, salt the boiling pasta water, and add the dry lasagna noodles to the boiling water.  (The water should be at a vigorous, rolling boil.) Stir gently, making sure that the noodles are not sticking to each other. Set the timer for 8 minutes, or however long is indicated on the package of the noodles. Cook uncovered on a high boil.\nWhen the noodles are ready (al dente, cooked through but still firm to the bite), drain the noodles in a colander, and rinse them to cool them with cold water.  As you rinse them, gently separate them with your fingers so they don't stick to each other.\n\nPrepare a couple large cookie sheets or baking sheets by spreading a tablespoon of olive oil over the baking sheets.\nPlace the lasagna noodles on the sheets, gently coating them with a bit of that olive oil, and spreading them out. This will help keep them from sticking to each other while you finish the sauce and prepare the layered casserole.\n\nAssemble the lasagna: Turn off the heat on the stovetop for the sauce. Preheat the oven to 350°F.\nSpread the one cup of reserved tomato sauce over the bottom of a large (preferably 10x15-inch) casserole dish. (If your casserole dish is smaller, you may need to add another layer as you go through this step.)\nPlace a layer of lasagna noodles down over the tomato sauce, slightly overlapping. (For our 10x15-inch dish, we ultimately fit 3 layers of 6 noodles each, with 2 extra noodles on which to nosh.)\nSprinkle half of the ricotta cheese over the noodles, and half of the defrosted, drained, and squeezed out spinach over the ricotta.\nSprinkle half of the mozzarella cheese over the spinach, and just a quarter of the pecorino cheese.\nThen spoon 1/3 of your mushroom sauce over the mozzarella. Sprinkle half of the fresh basil over the sauce.\n\nRepeat layers: Repeat the layering process. Place a second layer of noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining ricotta, spinach, and mozzarella over the noodles. Sprinkle another quarter of the pecorino along with the mozzarella. Top with another third of the mushroom sauce and the remaining fresh basil.\nLayer your final layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining sauce over the lasagna noodles, and sprinkle with the remaining pecorino or parmesan cheese.\n\nCover with foil and bake: Pull out a sheet of aluminum foil large enough to cover the casserole dish. Spread a little olive oil over the inside of the piece of foil (the side that will have contact with the lasagna). Place the foil over the casserole dish and crimp the edges.\nBake at 350°F for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake uncovered for an additional 25 minutes.\nTake the lasagna out of the oven when done and let it rest 10 minutes before cutting to serve. Once made, the lasagna will last a week in the fridge.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Sauté the mushrooms","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place mushrooms in a large (6 to 8 quart) sauté pan on high or medium high heat.

Add the zucchini, onions, garlic, green chiles, and jalapeño to the pan. Sprinkle with salt and cumin. Stir to coat the vegetables with the oil in the pan.\n \nSpread the veggies out in the pan and then stir only occasionally, until they are all lightly browned.\nStir in the chopped tomatoes and oregano, lower the heat to low. Let gently cook for several minutes while you are preparing the tortillas.\n\nSoften the tortillas: You are going to want to heat up the tortillas twice, first to soften them, and then to melt the cheese.\nThere are two basic ways of doing this. One way is on the stove top, preferably in a cast iron pan. Another way is to use the microwave. In both methods you will work in batches. (A third way is to use fresh homemade corn tortillas, which is a great option if you are set up for it.)\n\nPreparing tortillas on the stove-top Heat a dollop of olive oil (or other vegetable oil) in a large cast iron frying pan, on medium high. Add a tortilla to the pan, moving it around a bit, and turning it over, so that it spreads around the oil. Let the tortilla heat until it develops little bubbles of air pockets.\n\nThen place a piece of cheese on one side of the tortilla, and use a metal spatula to fold the other side of the tortilla over the cheese. Heat until cheese is melted, then remove from pan.\n \nNote that if you have a big enough pan, you can have one tortilla folded over while you have another tortilla doing its initial heating.\n\nPreparing tortillas in the microwave Place a paper towel (or half a paper towel) on the heating surface of your microwave. Spread out 2 tortillas on the paper towels.\nCook on high heat for 20 seconds per tortilla, in the case of 2 tortillas, 40 seconds. The tortillas should develop air pockets. (Note that every microwave is a little different, and corn tortillas differ as well. So you may need to adjust the times for your particular setup.)\n \nThen place a slice of cheese on one side of each tortilla and fold the tortillas over the cheese. Cook for an additional 10 seconds per tortilla (20 seconds for 2 tortillas), or until the cheese is melted.\n\nAdd sautéed vegetables to the tacos: Open the tacos and spoon some of the cooked veggie filling into them.\nSprinkle with chopped cilantro and crumbled cotija cheese. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Sauté the vegetables: ","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat a tablespoon or two of oil in a large sauté pan on medium high heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the zucchini, onions, garlic, green chiles, and jalapeño to the pan.
